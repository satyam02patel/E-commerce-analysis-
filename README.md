revenue by paymentmethod
Statistical Analysis
COD (25.73%) is the most used payment method, closely followed by Credit Card (25.3%), Net Banking (24.7%), and Debit Card (24.27%).
The revenue distribution is relatively balanced across all four payment methods, with only about 1.5% variation between the highest and lowest contributors.

Business Insights
All payment methods are performing well, indicating customers are comfortable using multiple payment options.
Since COD leads slightly, offering additional benefits (e.g., instant discounts) on digital payments could shift more users toward online modes, reducing operational risk and returns.

#top_10 Customers
Statistical Analysis:
Total Revenue and Quantity:
The top 10 customers collectively contributed ₹11,908.11 in revenue and 103 units in quantity, suggesting a strong average transaction value per customer (~₹1,190.81).
Distribution of Quantity:
The quantity ranges from 8 to 14 units, indicating relatively low variation. This suggests a fairly consistent purchasing pattern among top customers.

Business Insights:
High Revenue per Customer:
Each top customer contributes over ₹1,000 in revenue, with the highest being ₹1,321.53 (CustomerID 4072). Focusing retention efforts on these high-value customers could significantly impact profitability.
Customer Segmentation Opportunity:
Since some customers (e.g., ID 2184 with 14 units) buy in larger quantities, they may represent bulk buyers or loyal repeat customers. These could be targeted for exclusive offers or loyalty programs


#location wise order

Statistical Analysis:
Order Distribution Across Locations:
All three locations—Rural, Urban, and Suburban—have a similar number of orders, each around 1,000+, indicating a relatively balanced distribution.
Slight Rural Lead:
The Rural region has a marginally higher number of orders compared to Urban and Suburban areas, suggesting minor but measurable variation in order frequency.
 
 Business Insights:
Strong Rural Demand:
Contrary to common expectations, Rural areas are leading in order volume. This indicates a valuable and possibly underserved customer segment worth investing in (e.g., faster logistics, targeted campaigns).
Uniform Market Potential:
Since all three areas show similar order volumes, the business can apply broad marketing strategies across regions without needing drastically different campaigns.
